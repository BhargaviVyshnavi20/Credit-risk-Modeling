# Credit-risk-Modeling



## Overview

This project presents a machine learning-based solution for credit risk prediction, helping to assess the likelihood of loan default. It builds an end-to-end classification pipeline — from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment preparation. The focus is on creating a reliable model that can assist in risk assessment and decision-making.



### 🚀 Live Demo

You can access the live version of my application on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://credit-risk-modeling-hpfmcxrufhfpexuokmzapv.streamlit.app/)
